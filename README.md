# Headers of Boost v1.78.0
This is a repository with boost_1_78_0/boost folder to use as a submodule in other projects.
Use the ```ignore``` option to avoid slowness for git ([recommendation](https://github.com/boostorg/boost/issues/421) from [saki7](https://github.com/saki7)):
```
[submodule "external/boost"]
        path = external/boost
        url = https://github.com/nightelf3/boost-headers.git
        ignore = all
```

The boost project website is www.boost.org, where you can obtain more information and [download](https://www.boost.org/users/download/) the latest release.
